### Old docker-compose file 
* This is the docker-compose file I created for the proposal, which mimics the steps from the docker section of the Jenkins docker page.
* This file does not configure any agent.
* More info about the file can be found in the proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZpPihadYqpAvR20rxZkTD2SVpf34E6YMzg6opU6yHAg/edit#heading=h.lntg56ljm653).
### How to run 
* Make sure you are in the `00_old_one_from_proposal` directory by using the command `pwd`. 
* Then use the command `docker compose up -d` to run the example.
