# Persona

## First persona 
This person may have little to no knowledge about Docker Compose files or how they work. They may not be interested in learning about the technical details and just want to use Jenkins without having to worry about the setup process. They may not know much about Jenkins right now, but they want to experience what it is, how it works, looks and feels. They may be looking for a quick and easy way to get started with Jenkins without having to spend a lot of time on setup and configuration. 
For this person the the fully automated docker compose files and scripts are needed like you created in PR which works by only one command or maybe git clone(like in kubernetes part [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#jenkins-kubernetes-manifest-files)) from some repo before running docker compose up 

## Second Persona 
This person has a understanding of Docker and is interested in using Docker Compose to customise their Jenkins setup. They may want to learn more about how Docker and Jenkins work together and are willing to spend time learning about the technical details. They may be interested in optimising their workflow and making the most of the tools available. They may want to have more control over their setup and are willing to spend time customising it to meet their needs. and they want to know what exactly is running on their system before pressing enter
This is the person whom the simple docker compose files are aimed towards, to make it easy to understand how docker compose works with Jenkins
